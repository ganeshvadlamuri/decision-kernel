## What This Means

### Core is Frozen

The Decision Kernel core is frozen:
- `brain/` directory: No changes except critical bugs
- Adapter contract: Immutable
- Action Specification v1.0: Immutable
- WorldState Specification v1.0: Immutable
- Conformance requirements: Immutable

### Stability is Guaranteed

From this point forward:
- No breaking changes will occur
- No API modifications will occur
- No behavior changes will occur
- Code written today works forever

**This guarantee is active now, not at v1.0 release.**

### v1.0 Release Conditions

v1.0 will be released when real-world adoption evidence demonstrates:

**Educational Adoption**:
- 3+ universities using in courses
- 5+ workshops or tutorials delivered

**Research Adoption**:
- 5+ papers citing Decision Kernel
- 3+ research groups actively using

**Industry Validation**:
- 2+ companies using in development
- 1+ production deployment

**Community Growth**:
- 10+ contributors beyond founding team
- 3+ organizations contributing

**See**: docs/roadmap.md for complete criteria

### Purpose of Candidate Phase

This phase exists to:
- Gather external validation
- Demonstrate real-world viability
- Build adoption evidence
- Prove stability commitment

**Not** to:
- Add features
- Change interfaces
- Expand scope
- Refactor code

## What Remains Before v1.0

**Technical**: Nothing. Core is complete and frozen.

**Adoption**: Evidence of real-world use across education, research, and industry.

**Time**: No deadline. v1.0 releases when criteria are met.

## Stability Guarantee

**Active now**: All v1.0 stability guarantees are in effect during candidate phase.

Users can:
- Build production systems
- Teach courses
- Publish research
- Make long-term commitments

**With confidence that no breaking changes will occur.**

## Change Policy During Candidate Phase

**Default response to change requests**: No

**Exceptions**:
- Critical bugs (incorrect behavior)
- Security vulnerabilities
- Documentation clarifications

**Not exceptions**:
- Feature requests
- API improvements
- Convenience additions

## Candidate Phase Duration

**No time limit.**

Candidate phase continues until adoption criteria are met.

**Expectation**: Months to years, depending on adoption rate.

**Guarantee**: Stability maintained throughout, regardless of duration.

## After v1.0 Release

v1.0 release is ceremonial:
- Acknowledges adoption milestones reached
- Signals maturity to broader community
- No technical changes occur

**Stability commitment identical before and after v1.0 release.**

## Summary

Decision Kernel v1.0 Candidate means:
- Core is frozen

**Decision Kernel is finished. We are waiting for the world to notice.**
