# Decision Kernel v1.0 Candidate - Summary

**Date**: February 28, 2024  
**Status**: v1.0 Candidate (Active)  
**Version**: 0.9.x (v1.0 not released yet)

## Declaration

Decision Kernel has entered **v1.0 Candidate** status.

This is a declaration of completion, not a development milestone.

## What Changed

**Technical**: Nothing  
**Governance**: Everything

### Files Created (1)
- `docs/v1_candidate.md` - Candidate status declaration

### Files Modified (3)
- `README.md` - Added "v1.0 Candidate Status" section
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Added candidate phase entry
- `GOVERNANCE.md` - Added maintainer guidance for candidate phase

### Code Changes
**Zero**. No code modified. No behavior changed.

## What v1.0 Candidate Means

### Core is Frozen
- `brain/` directory: Immutable (except critical bugs)
- Adapter contract: Immutable
- Specifications: Immutable
- Conformance: Immutable

### Stability is Guaranteed Now
- No breaking changes will occur
- No API modifications will occur
- Code written today works forever
- **Guarantee active immediately, not at v1.0 release**

### v1.0 Release is Ceremonial
- Releases when adoption criteria met (education, research, industry)
- No technical changes at release
- Acknowledges maturity, doesn't create it

### Change Policy
- **Default response**: No
- **Exceptions**: Critical bugs, security, documentation
- **Not exceptions**: Features, improvements, optimizations

## What Remains Before v1.0

**Technical work**: None. Core is complete.

**Adoption evidence**:
- 3+ universities using in courses
- 5+ papers citing Decision Kernel
- 2+ companies using in development
- 10+ contributors beyond founding team

**Time**: No deadline. Releases when criteria met.

## Verification

All checks passing:
```
✅ CLI works
✅ Tests: 57/57 passing
✅ No code changes
✅ No behavior changes
✅ Version: 0.9.x (not 1.0 yet)
```

## What This Feels Like

**Before Candidate**: "Is this stable enough to use?"  
**After Candidate**: "This is finished. I can commit."

**Before Candidate**: "Will they change the API?"  
**After Candidate**: "API is frozen. Guaranteed."

**Before Candidate**: "Should I wait for v1.0?"  
**After Candidate**: "v1.0 is just a ceremony. Stability is now."

## Key Messages

1. **Decision Kernel is finished**
   - Core complete
   - Specs frozen
   - Contracts immutable

2. **Stability is guaranteed now**
   - Not waiting for v1.0
   - Active immediately
   - Enforced by governance

3. **v1.0 is adoption milestone**
   - Not technical milestone
   - Releases when world validates
   - No changes at release

4. **Safe to commit long-term**
   - Build production systems
   - Teach courses
   - Publish research
   - No breaking changes ever

## Maintainer Guidance

**During candidate phase**:
- Default to "no" on all change requests
- Allow only: Critical bugs, security, documentation
- Reject: Features, improvements, refactoring, optimizations
- Protect stability above all

**Philosophy**: Decision Kernel is infrastructure. Infrastructure doesn't change.

## Timeline

**Candidate phase duration**: Months to years (no deadline)

**v1.0 release**: When adoption criteria met

**Stability guarantee**: Active throughout candidate phase and beyond

## Historical Context

Decision Kernel journey:
- v0.1-0.4: Core development
- v0.5: Reference standard (ROS2 adapter, governance)
- v0.6: Adoption acceleration (demos, ecosystem kit)
- v0.7: Cross-environment proof (Webots adapter, compatibility)
- v0.8: External legitimacy (whitepaper, education, adopters)
- v0.9: Core freeze (freeze policy, stability commitment)
- **v1.0 Candidate**: Declaration of completion

**Next**: v1.0 when world validates (not when we decide)

## Summary

Decision Kernel v1.0 Candidate means:
- ✅ Core is frozen
- ✅ Stability is guaranteed
- ✅ Safe to commit long-term
- ✅ Waiting for adoption evidence
- ✅ No technical work remains

**Decision Kernel is finished. We are waiting for the world to notice.**

**This is not a development phase. This is a validation phase.**

**The work is done. The waiting begins.**
